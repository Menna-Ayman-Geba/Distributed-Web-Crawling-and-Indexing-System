# Distributed-Web-Crawling-and-Indexing-System
This project focuses on building a distributed web crawling and indexing system utilizing cloud computing technologies. Developed in Python 3.9 , the system leverages cloud-hosted virtual machines for scalable and efficient distributed processing. It employs distributed task queues and storage to crawl websites and construct a searchable index of web pages. A major emphasis is placed on fault tolerance, ensuring the system remains operational and continues processing even in the event of partial failures.
